Recordings of all sessions will be uploaded to YouTube and shared on the event website.


This Winter School is to offer examples of the direct applications of machine learning methods to a range of problems inspired by **the use of Artificial Intelligence in Physics**. We will provide hands-on experiences with machine learning tools to help reduce the barriers to engagement with these essential tools for physics research. 

_Note: I am just an online partcipant attending the school_
