These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at\\nT1 ∼ 0.065 K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce 2Zr2O7 and Ce2Sn2O7.\\nHowever a second, sharper peak is observed at T2 ∼ 0.025 K, which signifies the entrance to its\\nground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to CP = 0 at T = 0 K gives a\\nfull accounting of R ln(2) in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce3+\\nin this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a\\nmuch larger anomaly in CP , at much higher temperatures than the measured T2, for expectations\\nfrom an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce 2Hf2O7. The\\nsharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid\\nregime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce 2Hf2O7 at low temperatures\\nbetween T2 and T1 resembles that observed from Ce 2Zr2O7, which is well established as a π-flux\\nquantum spin ice.\\nCerium-based pyrochlore insulators have recently at-\\ntracted attention as the best candidates to display quan-\\ntum spin ice (QSI) ground states. QSIs are a specific\\nform of quantum spin liquid, and ones which map on\\nto an emergent quantum electrodynamics with exotic\\nelementary excitations corresponding to magnetic and\\nelectric monopoles as well as emergent photons [ 1–6]. For\\nthese pyrochlores, with Ce 3+ ions decorating networks\\nof corner-sharing tetrahedra, crystal electric field (CEF)\\neffects break the J = 5/2 Hund’s rule ground state into\\nthree well separated doublets [7–11], and yield a quantum\\npseudospin-1/2 degree of freedom at low temperature [12–\\n15]. The wavefunctions associated with the CEF ground\\nstate doublet correspond to a z-component of pseudospin\\nwith a dipole moment, while the x and y components\\ncarry octupole moments and transform differently under\\ntime-reversal symmetry and the point group symmetry at\\nthe Ce-site. Hence the corresponding QSI states can have\\neither a dipolar or octupolar character [ 14, 16–18], and\\nsuch materials are known as dipole-octupole pyrochlores.\\nExperimental work on cerium-based pyrochlores is most\\nadvanced on single crystal Ce 2Zr2O7 [8, 9, 19–26], where\\ndetailed cases have been made for Ce 2Zr2O7 displaying a\\nπ-flux QSI ground state. Prior studies have focused on\\nestimating the interaction parameters in the symmetry-\\nallowed XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce 2Zr2O7 through com-\\nparison of measurements to relevant theory [ 19, 20, 22].\\nChanglani et al.[20] concluded that the magnetic ground\\nstate in Ce 2Zr2O7 is an octupolar QSI while Smith et\\nal. [19, 22] concluded that the magnetic ground state in\\nCe2Zr2O7 is a QSI near the boundary between the dipolar\\nand octupolar regimes. While the estimated interaction\\nparameters and corresponding magnetic ground states\\nvary slightly between Ref. [ 20] and Refs. [ 19, 22], both\\nworks suggest a rare QSI in Ce2Zr2O7, consistent with the\\noriginal reports of QSI behavior in Refs. [ 8, 9]. More re-\\ncent gauge mean field theory calculations from Desrochers\\net al. [27, 28] for a π-flux QSI ground state of the XYZ\\nHamiltonian can account for both the low-temperature\\nstructure factor and the zone boundary non-spin-flip scat-\\ntering from Ce2Zr2O7 [8, 9, 19]. Together these provide a\\nstrong case for Ce 2Zr2O7 displaying a π-flux QSI ground\\nstate.\\nCe2Sn2O7, another dipole-octupole pyrochlore, has also\\nbeen examined.

However this material\\nhas also presented synthesis challenges. While large single\\ncrystals can be grown, the ones grown previously are black\\nin color, which is not typical of insulators and implies\\nstructural disorder.\\nAn important issue relevant to all of these previous\\nstudies on Ce-based pyrochlores is that the energy scale\\nof the underlying XYZ Hamiltonian is on order of 1 K or\\nless [10, 19, 20, 22, 30, 31], and it is difficult to perform\\nequilibrium measurements below T ∼ 0.1 K. To date, no\\nheat capacity measurements with T below ∼ 0.06 K have\\nbeen published for any of the Ce-based pyrochlores. This\\nis a key issue as existing measurements do not allow full\\ncoverage of the Schottky-like peak at low temperature in\\nany of these three systems, let alone allow for study of\\nthe true quantum ground state regime.\\nIn this letter, we report heat capacity measurements\\non a high quality single crystal of Ce 2Hf2O7, which ex-\\ntend a factor of ∼ 3 lower in temperature than those\\npreviously-reported on any Ce-based pyrochlore. These\\nmeasurements access the ground state and recover virtu-\\nally all of the R ln(2) entropy associated with the Ce 3+\\nCEF ground state doublet.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our high quality single crystal of\\nCe2Hf2O7 is light greenish-yellow as expected for a high\\nCe3+ to Ce4+ ratio [8], and semi-transparent as expected\\nfor a magnetic insulator with little structural disorder.

[11, 31]. Each of these display a hump in Cmag with\\nmaximum just aboveT ∼ 0.1 K [inset to Fig. 2(a)]. This is\\nabove the temperature of the maximum in theCmag hump\\nmeasured from Ce2Hf2O7 in this work, T1 ∼ 0.065 K. On\\ndecreasing temperature below T1 ∼ 0.065 K, the Cmag\\nfrom the new Ce 2Hf2O7 crystal is approximately con-\\nstant to T ∼ 0.03 K before rising again to the second\\nlow-temperature peak at T2 ∼ 0.025 K.\\nThis low-temperature peak in Cmag at T2 ∼ 0.025 K\\ncould signify a phase transition to an ordered state in\\nCe2Hf2O7. However, we argue below that this peak is\\nmuch smaller than that expected from a transition to\\nan all-in all-out ordered ground state of the symmetry-\\nallowed near-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian, and it also oc-\\ncurs too low in temperature by approximately a factor of 5.\\nAccordingly, if the peak in Cmag does indicate an ordering\\ntransition, then the ordered state likely possesses signifi-\\ncant interactions not included in the near-neighbor XYZ\\nHamiltonian, such as dipole-dipole interactions beyond\\nnearest neighbors for example.\\nTo understand our new data quantitatively, we fol-\\nlow earlier work on Ce 2Zr2O7 (Ref. [19]) and Ce2Sn2O7\\n(Ref. [ 30]) and compare the Cmag measured from our\\nsingle crystal of Ce 2Hf2O7 with numerical linked cluster\\n(NLC) calculations [ 33, 34], which allows estimates for\\nthe nearest-neighbor exchange parameters in the XYZ\\nHamiltonian relevant to Ce2Hf2O7. The calculations are\\nperformed using a permutation of the XYZ Hamiltonian’s\\nexchange parameters which are conventionally called Ja,\\nJb, and Jc, where |Ja| ≥ |Jb|, |Jc| and Jb ≥ Jc. This allows\\na unique fit to Cmag but does not specify the permutation\\nrelating (Ja, Jb, Jc) to the XYZ Hamiltonian parameters\\n(J˜x, J˜y, J˜z). This procedure determines whether the cor-\\nresponding ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian is an\\nordered phase or a QSI phase but does not distinguish\\nbetween the octupolar or dipolar nature of the ground\\nstate.\\nFollowing earlier work [19], this nearest-neighbor Hamil-\\ntonian can be written as:\\nHABC =\\nX\\n⟨ij⟩\\n[JaSi\\naSj\\na − J±(Si\\n+Sj\\n− + Si\\n−Sj\\n+)\\n+ J±±(Si\\n+Sj\\n+ + Si\\n−Sj\\n−)]\\n(1)\\nin zero field, where J± = −1\\n4 (Jb + Jc), J±± = 1\\n4 (Jb − Jc).\\nHere Sj\\na is the a-component of pseudospin-1/2 for the\\nCe3+ ion j in its local {a, b, c} coordinate frame, and\\nSj\\n± = Sj\\nb ± iSj\\nc.

However, QMC calculations can\\nstill be performed for the ordered phases [ 2, 14, 16] and\\nspecifically for the best fit B-parameters [Fig. 3(a)]. The\\nQMC calculations of Cmag using the B parameters show a\\nwell-defined peak at ∼ 0.15 K, indicative of a phase transi-\\ntion to an ordered state. However, this high-temperature\\nCmag anomaly is larger by more than a factor of 10 in the\\nQMC calculation compared to experiment. It also occurs\\na factor of ∼ 5 too high in temperature.\\nOur new measurements of Ce 2Hf2O7’s Cmag account\\nfor the full R ln(2) entropy expected for pseudospin-1/2\\ndegrees of freedom. This markedly differs from earlier\\nCmag measurements on Ce-based pyrochlores [9, 10, 19, 29–\\n31], where at best (in the case of Ce 2Zr2O7 [9, 19]) only\\n∼ 79% of R ln(2) is accounted for by the measurements,\\nand the rest must be accounted for by extrapolating the\\nmeasured Cmag to zero temperature.\\nThis is illustrated in the inset to Fig. 3(b) where the\\nmeasured Cmag from Ce2Hf2O7 is shown along with two\\npossible simple extrapolation schemes: one (cubic) cor-\\nresponding to gapless excitations and one (exponential)\\ncorresponding to gapped excitations. The corresponding\\nentropy accounted for by this data is shown in Fig. 3(b).\\nIt is clear that the data itself, without extrapolation,\\naccounts for ∼ R ln(2) in entropy within 2%. The expo-\\nnential extrapolation in Fig. 3(b) uses a gap energy of\\n0.025 meV, the value determined from the high energy-\\nresolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements on\\nCe2Hf2O7 in Ref. [ 31]. Any low-temperature extrapo-\\nlation of the Cmag data consistent with R ln(2) entropy\\nmust be very abrupt in order to not overshoot R ln(2).\\nWe also performed both low and high energy neutron\\nspectroscopy on Ce 2Hf2O7. The high energy neutron\\nspectroscopy, shown in the Supplemental Material, in-\\nforms on the CEF states and are largely consistent with\\npreviously published work [ 11], and specifically with a\\ndipole-octupole CEF ground state doublet. The low-\\nenergy spectroscopy on our Ce 2Hf2O7 single crystal was\\nperformed with the LET spectrometer at the ISIS Neu-\\ntron and Muon Source down to T = 0.035 K, and can be\\ncompared to earlier measurements from Ce 2Zr2O7.\\nFig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) show the powder-averaged inelas-\\ntic neutron scattering from our single crystal of Ce2Hf2O7\\nfor a ||Q|| integration over [0.3, 0.6] ˚A\\n−1\\nand for energy\\nintegration over [0.1, 0.2] meV, respectively, at tempera-\\ntures between T = 0.035 K and T = 5 K with T = 10 K\\ndataset subtracted.

We further investigate which\\npermutations of the A and B parameters are reasonable\\nusing NLC calculations to fit the magnetic susceptibility\\nof Ce2Hf2O7 in the Supplemental Material.\\nA scenario consistent with the A parameters is that\\nthe weaker peak at T2 ∼ 0.025 K does not indicate a\\nphase transition, but rather a cross-over between two\\ndistinct disordered phases [ 18, 38, 39].

However,\\ndepending on their effective speed of light, their T3 con-\\ntribution may only enter at very low temperatures [ 4].\\nFurthermore, interactions between visons and photons can\\nalso cause the photons to develop an effective temperature\\ndependent gap [41].\\nRecent work [42] has investigated the XYZ Hamiltonian\\nat the mean-field level and has shown that the QSI ground\\nstate can be in close competition with a gapped Z2 quan-\\ntum spin liquid phase over a large region of parameter\\nspace containing the A parameters from our NLC fit-\\nting. Due to this close competition, they reason that this\\ngapped Z2 quantum spin liquid phase should be consid-\\nered on equal footing with the QSI ground states predicted\\nfor the XYZ Hamiltonian using mean-field methods [see\\nFig. 2(b)], as fluctuations beyond the mean-field level\\ncould easily alter the relative energies of these phases.

The use of\\nlow-temperature extrapolations of Cmag can be important\\nin recovering the full R ln(2) entropy associated with a\\nCEF ground state doublet [ 19], especially considering the\\nweighting by 1/T in Cmag/T.\\nNotably, even without extrapolation of Cmag below\\nthe lowest-temperature data point, the recovered entropy\\nfrom the lowest-temperature data point to T = 10 K\\nexceeds the value of R ln(2) expected for a CEF ground\\nstate doublet, by about 2% of R ln(2), despite the fact\\nthat the conclusion of a CEF ground state doublet in\\nCe2Hf2O7 is a robust conclusion (see Ref. [ 11] and below\\nin SM). This apparent inconsistency may be due to the\\nfact that La2Hf2O7 measurements were used to estimate\\nthe phonon contribution in the measured heat capacity\\nfrom Ce2Hf2O7. In fact, a slight overestimation of R ln(2)\\nis generally consistent with expectations based on the\\nfact that La3+ is lighter than Ce3+: Because of this mass\\ndifference, one would generally expect some phonons to\\nbe at slightly higher energies for La 2Hf2O7 compared to\\nthe analogous phonons for Ce 2Hf2O7, and this would be\\nconsistent with an undersubtraction of the phonon contri-\\nbution for Ce2Hf2O7 when using this method. However,\\nthere are also other factors that may cause or contribute\\nto this. For example, any overestimation of Cmag (but\\nstill within the error bars) would lead to a corresponding\\noverestimation of the entropy integral of Cmag/T. Due to\\nexperimental factors like these, it is common for measured\\nentropies to vary from their expected values within about\\n5%.

This time-of-flight exper-\\niment used incident neutron energies of Ei = 1.77 meV\\nand Ei = 3.7 meV with 240 Hz chopper frequency, yield-\\ning energy resolutions of ∼0.04 meV ( Ei = 1.77 meV)\\nand ∼0.08 meV (Ei = 3.7 meV) at the elastic line. For\\nthis experiment, our ∼3.5 gram single crystal sample of\\nCe2Hf2O7 was mounted in a copper sample holder and\\naligned in the ( H, H, L) scattering plane. For each mea-\\nsured temperature of our LET experiment, the sample\\nwas rotated in the ( H, H, L) plane in 2 ◦ steps through a\\ntotal of 360◦ and the data was subsequently symmetrized.\\nThis symmetrization process helps wash out scattering\\nfrom the sample holder and sample environment equip-\\nment, in favor of scattering from Ce 2Hf2O7 (which obeys\\nthe applied symmetries). This symmetrization process is\\nfurther discussed in the supplemental material of Ref.

This dataset in\\nthe (H, H, L) plane uses an integration in the out-of-plane\\ndirection, (K, ¯K, 0), over the range K = [−0.1, 0.1].\\nThe onset of the inelastic magnetic neutron scatter-\\ning signal from Ce 2Hf2O7 with decreasing temperature\\nis shown by the powder-averaged temperature-difference\\ndata in Fig. 4(a,b) of the main text.

Specifically, Fig. S5 shows posi-\\ntive net scattering with energy-center near E = 0.1 meV,\\nwhich onsets by T = 2 K and grows in intensity with\\ndecreasing temperature. Importantly, Fig. S5 shows no\\nsigns for magnetic Bragg peaks at any ||Q|| in agreement\\nwith our neutron diffraction data in Fig. S4.\\nThe energy integration used in Fig. 4 of the main text,\\nover the range E = [0.1, 0.2] meV, was chosen to cover\\nthe dominant portion of the positive net scattering in\\nthe temperature-difference inelastic neutron scattering\\nsignal, while avoiding negative net scattering centered on\\nE = 0 meV that likely results from subtraction of param-\\nagnetic elastic scattering at high temperature. This nega-\\ntive net scattering is shown as dark blue in the powder-\\naveraged temperature-difference data of Fig. S5.

In general, when a description in\\nterms of pseudospin is permitted by a CEF ground state\\nthat is well-separated in energy from the excited CEF\\nstates, the symmetry of the crystal electric field ground\\nstate dictates the general form of the pseudospin inter-\\naction Hamiltonian [15]. The pseudospin-1/2 interaction\\nHamiltonian for pyrochlores with a dipole-octupole CEF\\nground state doublet is given by [14, 15]:\\nHDO =\\nX\\n⟨ij⟩\\n[JxSi\\nxSj\\nx + JySi\\nySj\\ny + JzSi\\nzSj\\nz\\n+ Jxz(Si\\nxSj\\nz + Si\\nzSj\\nx)] − gzµB\\nX\\ni\\nh · ˆzi Si\\nz ,\\n(2)\\nwhere Si\\nα (α = x, y, z) are the pseudospin components\\nof the rare-earth atom i in the local {x, y, z} coordinate\\nframe. This coordinate frame is defined locally for each ion\\ni with the zi anisotropy axis along the threefold rotation\\naxis through rare-earth site i and with yi along one of the\\nsymmetrically equivalent twofold rotation axes through\\nrare-earth site i, where xi = yi × zi. The second sum\\nrepresents the Zeeman interaction between the rare-earth\\nion and the magnetic field h. The anisotropic g-factor gz\\nis determined by the CEF ground state doublet, which\\ngives gz = 2.57 for the pure |mJ = ±3/2⟩ ground state\\ndoublet estimated for Ce3+ in Ce2Hf2O7 (in Ref. [31] and\\nbelow in this Supplemental Material).\\nThis nearest-neighbor exchange Hamiltonian can then\\nbe simplified via rotation of each local {x, y, z} coordinate\\nframe by θ about the respective local y-axis, where θ is\\ngiven by [14, 47]:\\nθ = 1\\n2 tan−1\\n\\x12 2Jxz\\nJx − Jz\\n\\x13\\n.

This is\\nthe Hamiltonian we use for our numerical linked cluster\\n(NLC) calculations and it is also shown in Eq. 1 of the\\nmain text.\\nWe use the NLC method with the Hamiltonian HABC\\nto calculate Cmag over the available parameter space of\\nHABC. We compare these calculations with the Cmag re-\\nported for Ce2Hf2O7 in this work and determine values of\\n(Ja, Jb, Jc) that give the best agreement between the cal-\\nculation and measurement. The NLC method calculates\\nCmag (or other physical quantities) by first calculating the\\ncontributions from different sized clusters of tetrahedra\\nin the pyrochlore lattice, and ignoring the contributions\\nfrom larger clusters which only become relevant at tem-\\nperatures below a low-temperature cutoff. The order of\\nthese quantum NLC calculations refers to the maximum\\nnumber of tetrahedra considered in a cluster, NLC cal-\\nculations up to seventh order were preformed to model\\nCmag. Further details of the NLC method are provided\\nin Ref. [ 33, 34, 48–50] for example. The methodology\\nspecific to the seventh-order calculations is described in\\nRef. [33].\\nThroughout this paper, we compare the magnetic heat\\ncapacity calculated using sixth-order NLC calculations,\\nCNLC,6\\nmag , to the magnetic heat capacity measured from\\nsingle crystal Ce2Hf2O7, Cexp\\nmag, using the goodness-of-fit\\nmeasure,\\n\\x1cδ2\\nϵ2\\n\\x1d\\nC\\n=\\nX\\nTexp\\n[CNLC,6\\nmag (Texp) − Cexp\\nmag(Texp)]2\\nϵC,NLC,6(Texp)2 + ϵC,exp(Texp)2 , (6)\\nwhere ϵC,exp(Texp) is the experimental uncertainty on\\nthe measured heat capacity at temperature Texp, and\\nϵC,NLC,6(Texp) is the uncertainty associated with the sixth-\\norder NLC calculations at temperature Texp,\\nϵC,NLC,6(Texp) = maxT≥Texp |CNLC,6\\nmag (T) − CNLC,5\\nmag (T)|,\\n(7)\\nwhere CNLC,5\\nmag is the magnetic heat capacity calculated\\nusing fifth-order NLC calculations.\\nWe first used sixth-order NLC calculations, with Eu-\\nler transformations to improve convergence (see Ref. [ 19]\\nfor example), in order to fit the zero-field heat capacity\\nmeasured from Ce2Hf2O7 and determine the best-fitting\\nexchange parameters Ja, Jb, and Jc. Specifically, Cmag\\ncurves were calculated for values of (Ja, Jb, Jc) over the en-\\ntire available parameter space, and we compare the NLC-\\ncalculated heat capacity for each parameter set to the heat\\ncapacity measured from Ce 2Hf2O7 using the goodness-of-\\nfit measure ⟨δ2\\nϵ2 ⟩C in Eq. 6. The overall energy scale of\\nthe exchange parameters was fit to the high-temperature\\ntail of the heat capacity so as to minimize ⟨δ2\\nϵ2 ⟩C summed\\nover the range from Texp = 1.5 K to 3 K (see Ref. [ 30]\\nfor example). The exchange parameters Ja, Jb, and Jc\\nare then determined according to minimization of ⟨δ2\\nϵ2 ⟩C\\nsummed over the range from Texp = 0.1 K to 1.5 K. For\\nmost parameter sets, and specifically those corresponding\\nto a QSI ground state in the nearest-neighbor ground\\nstate phase diagram [Fig. 2(b) of the main text], this\\nrestricts the fit to the regime where the NLC calculations\\nconverge. The value of ⟨δ2\\nϵ2 ⟩C over available parameter\\nspace is shown in Fig. 2(b) of the main text. The results\\nof this fitting procedure yields the best fitting parame-\\nters (Ja, Jb, Jc) = (0 .050, 0.021, 0.004) meV [labeled as\\nA in Fig. 2(b) of the main text] and the local minimum\\n(Ja, Jb, Jc) = (0.051, 0.008, −0.018) meV [labeled as B in\\nFig. 2(b) of the main text].\\nThe seventh-order NLC calculations using the A and\\nB parameters are shown in Fig. 2(a) of the main text.\\nThe sixth and seventh order NLC calculations for the\\nA parameters are converged with one another down to\\nT ∼ 0.05 K, while for the B parameters they diverge\\nfrom one another below T ∼ 0.15 K. This difference in\\nconvergence is due to the different phases described by\\nthese parameters.\\nNUMERICAL LINKED CLUSTER\\nCALCULATIONS OFS(Q)\\nIn this section we discuss our sixth-order NLC calcula-\\ntions of the equal-time structure factor S(Q). The details\\nof these calculations are described in Refs. [ 24, 51]. Here\\nwe compute S(Q) for different permutations of the A and\\nB parameter sets for the XYZ Hamiltonian, obtained from\\nour NLC fitting to the Cmag measured from Ce 2Hf2O7,\\nand for different values of θ parameter (see Eq. 4). We\\nallow θ to vary in the range from 0 to π/4. This is enough\\nto cover all distinguishable scenarios, since changing the\\nsign of θ does not affect any quantity considered here, and\\nshifting θ to θ + π/2 is the same as reversing the sign of\\nθ and swapping the values of J˜x and J˜z, which is already\\ncovered by considering all six permutations of exchange\\nparameters.\\nFig. S6 shows the NLC-calculated S(Q) for the six\\ndifferent permutations of the A parameters, ( Ja, Jb, Jc) =\\n(0.050, 0.021, 0.004) meV, for θ = 0.

This\\nincident energy was used to probe the transitions from the\\nCEF ground state doublet to the first and second excited\\nstate doublets. Fig. S16(a) shows the Ei = 150 meV neu-\\ntron scattering powder spectra measured from Ce 2Hf2O7\\nat T = 5 K, with the subtraction of a dataset measured\\non an empty sample holder. We observe two clear CEF\\nexcitations in the Ei = 150 meV powder spectra, high-\\nlighted by black arrows at E ∼ 58 meV and E ∼ 111 meV\\nin Fig. S16(a), identifiable by their lack of dispersion and\\nthe fact that their intensity decreases with increasing||Q||\\nconsistent with the Ce3+ magnetic form factor.\\nThe spin and angular momentum quantum numbers for\\n4f 1 Ce3+, S = 1/2 and L = 3, give a spin-orbit ground\\nstate manifold with angular momentum quantum number\\nof J = |L − S| = 5 /2 according to Hund’s rules, and\\none excited spin-orbit manifold with J = L + S = 7/2.\\nThe spin-orbit gap for Ce 3+ is on the order of 200 meV\\n(Ref. [54]) and dominates the weaker CEF splitting, al-\\nlowing for a reasonable approximation using the Russel-\\nSaunders coupling scheme where the CEF splitting does\\nnot induce mixing between the J = 5/2 and J = 7/2\\nstates, which we employ in our upcoming analysis.\\nThe temperature used, T = 5 K, is sufficiently low\\nenough to avoid significant thermal population of excited\\nCEF states, such that the only CEF transitions with\\nobservable intensity are transitions originating from the\\nCEF ground state. Furthermore, given that Ce 3+ is a\\nKramer’s ion, the CEF states cannot be split any further\\nthan doublets. Therefore, considering there are 2J +1 = 6\\nstates in total within theJ = 5/2 manifold, the two strong\\nCEF transitions detected in our Ei = 150 meV data\\nshould constitute all transitions from the CEF ground\\nstate to excited states within the J = 5 /2 spin-orbit\\nmanifold.\\nHowever, we also identify a third, weaker, dispersion-\\nless excitation at E ∼ 104 meV which also appears to\\ndecrease in intensity with increasing ||Q||, highlighted by\\nthe grey arrow in Fig. S16(a). We attribute this excita-\\ntion at E ∼ 104 meV to a potential vibronic bound state\\nbetween CEF excitation and phonon. This is consistent\\nwith the high-energy inelastic neutron scattering data\\nreported for Ce2Hf2O7 in Ref. [11], which shows a simi-\\nlar dispersionless excitation around E ∼ 100 meV with\\nintensity that decreases with increasing ||Q||. In fact, a\\nsimilar potential vibronic bound state was also detected\\nat E ∼ 100 meV in the inelastic neutron scattering data\\nreported for Ce 2Zr2O7, albeit, more clearly in Ref. [ 8]\\nthan in Ref. [ 9]. In contrast to this, the high-energy in-\\nelastic neutron scattering data reported for Ce 2Sn2O7, in\\nRef. [10], shows no signs for a potential vibronic bound\\nstate near E ∼ 100 meV.

A T = 5 K dataset measured from the empty sample-holder was subtracted to help isolate the\\nscattering from Ce2Hf2O7. Two strong excitations, at E ∼ 58 meV and E ∼ 111 meV, can be identified as CEF excitations due\\nto their dispersionless nature the fact that their intensity decreases with increasing ||Q||, consistent with the Ce 3+ magnetic\\nform factor. A third, weaker, dispersionless excitation also appears to be consistent with the Ce 3+ magnetic form factor, and\\nis visible at E ∼ 104 meV.

Specifically, we fit the\\nEi = 150 meV spectra in Fig. S16(a) to determining the\\nenergy values and intensity ratio for the two lowest lying\\nCEF excitations, E1, E2, and I1/I2, with and without\\nthe vibronic bound state included in the determining E2\\nand I2. For the analysis with the vibronic bound state\\nincluded, I2 is the sum of intensities of the potential vi-\\nbronic bound state at E ∼ 104 meV and the strong CEF\\nexcitation at E ∼ 111 meV, and E2 is determined by\\nan intensity-weighted average of the energies for each of\\nthese excitations. We use the Stevens operator formalism\\nwithin the J = 5/2 spin-orbit ground state manifold, and\\nfor each analysis the parameters of CEF Hamiltonian\\nare refined in order to determine the CEF Hamiltonian\\nthat best-reproduces the measured values of E1, E2, and\\nI1/I2.\\nThe CEF Hamiltonian for Ce 3+, within the J = 5/2\\nspin-orbit ground state manifold, is given in the Stevens\\noperator formalism as [66, 67]:\\nHCEF = B0\\n2 ˆO0\\n2 + B0\\n4 ˆO0\\n4 + B3\\n4 ˆO3\\n4, (11)\\nwhere ˆOm\\nn are Stevens operators, which are polynomials of\\norder n in the total angular momentum operators [67, 68].\\nIt is worth mentioning that the CEF Hamiltonian in the\\nStevens operator formalism usually contains six terms\\nfor the D3d symmetry corresponding to the magnetic site\\nin the pyrochlore lattice [ 66].

[11], which has a highest incident energy\\nof Ei = 450 meV which is insufficient to view the E ∼\\n475 meV transition that we detect in this work. Similarly,\\nRef. [8] reports a CEF excitation at E ∼ 270 meV but\\nuses a highest incident energy of Ei = 500 meV making a\\nweak CEF transition near E ∼ 475 meV undetectable due\\nto noise near the edge of the measurement range.

The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a\n","much larger anomaly in CP , at much higher temperatures than the measured T2, for expectations\n","from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce 2Hf2O7. The\n","sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid\n","regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce 2Hf2O7 at low temperatures\n","between T2 and T1 resembles that observed from Ce 2Zr2O7, which is well established as a π-flux\n","quantum spin ice.\n","Cerium-based pyrochlore insulators have recently at-\n","tracted attention as the best candidates to display quan-\n","tum spin ice (QSI) ground states. QSIs are a specific\n","form of quantum spin liquid, and ones which map on\n","to an emergent quantum electrodynamics with exotic\n","elementary excitations corresponding to magnetic and\n","electric monopoles as well as emergent photons [ 1–6]. For\n","these pyrochlores, with Ce 3+ ions decorating networks\n","of corner-sharing tetrahedra, crystal electric field (CEF)\n","effects break the J = 5/2 Hund’s rule ground state into\n","three well separated doublets [7–11], and yield a quantum\n","pseudospin-1/2 degree of freedom at low temperature [12–\n","15]. The wavefunctions associated with the CEF ground\n","state doublet correspond to a z-component of pseudospin\n","with a dipole moment, while the x and y components\n","carry octupole moments and transform differently under\n","time-reversal symmetry and the point group symmetry at\n","the Ce-site. Hence the corresponding QSI states can have\n","either a dipolar or octupolar character [ 14, 16–18], and\n","such materials are known as dipole-octupole pyrochlores.\n","Experimental work on cerium-based pyrochlores is most\n","advanced on single crystal Ce 2Zr2O7 [8, 9, 19–26], where\n","detailed cases have been made for Ce 2Zr2O7 displaying a\n","π-flux QSI ground state. Prior studies have focused on\n","estimating the interaction parameters in the symmetry-\n","allowed XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce 2Zr2O7 through com-\n","parison of measurements to relevant theory [ 19, 20, 22].\n","Changlani et al.[20] concluded that the magnetic ground\n","state in Ce 2Zr2O7 is an octupolar QSI while Smith et\n","al. [19, 22] concluded that the magnetic ground state in\n","Ce2Zr2O7 is a QSI near the boundary between the dipolar\n","and octupolar regimes. While the estimated interaction\n","parameters and corresponding magnetic ground states\n","vary slightly between Ref. [ 20] and Refs. [ 19, 22], both\n","works suggest a rare QSI in Ce2Zr2O7, consistent with the\n","original reports of QSI behavior in Refs. [ 8, 9]. More re-\n","cent gauge mean field theory calculations from Desrochers\n","et al. [27, 28] for a π-flux QSI ground state of the XYZ\n","Hamiltonian can account for both the low-temperature\n","structure factor and the zone boundary non-spin-flip scat-\n","tering from Ce2Zr2O7 [8, 9, 19]. Together these provide a\n","strong case for Ce 2Zr2O7 displaying a π-flux QSI ground\n","state.\n","Ce2Sn2O7, another dipole-octupole pyrochlore, has also\n","been examined.
